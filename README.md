# Javascript-Calculator

a fully functional Calculator that is able to:
- do basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division function
- able to work with multiple numbers
- have a dedicated CLEAR button to clear the memory
- have a dedicated DELETE button to delete the current type number

However, it is currently lack some function:
- Unable to give piority to multiplication and division

I will try to add them in the future but for now, This is my complete work for Odin Project's Calculator exercise.
